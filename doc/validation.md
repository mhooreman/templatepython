# Computerized system validation

This package is provided "as this", without formal computerized systems
validation.

Anyway, validation needs are kept in mind in the project design, leading to
enforced development best practices (see [development](development.md)),
including but not limited to:

- Change control in GitHub project ticketing
- Controled dependcies management
- Software documentation (this document)
- Enforced type hinting
- Enforced coding best practices and pitfalls detection
- Automated versioning and packaging
- Unit tests with coverage metrics (limited, but continuously increasing)
